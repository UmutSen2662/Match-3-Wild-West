# Match 3 Wild West

Match 3 Wild West is a simple highscore based match 3 game made in godot [godot 4.2.1](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.2.1-stable/) I made this game to start learning godot game devolopment so it is very much spaghetti code.

## Installation

To install you can either clone this repo and access the folder using [godot 4.2.1](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.2.1-stable/) or you can click dowload as zip in the green code button and extact to do the same thing.

## Roadmap

I don't really have any plans for this but I will continue to add stuff when I think of them. I am open to suggestions and criticism if you have anything to tell me please do so. Also I might do a restructering of the code later on when I am more experienced with how everything is usally done in godot or game dev in general.
